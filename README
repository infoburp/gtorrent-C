This is a wrapper that allows non-harmful C code to use the harmful C++ code that gtorrent's core uses.
This is ONLY the core, not the GUI.

The C header file to include is "core/gtorrent-core.h".

gtorrent is under heavy development and is very likely to change and break this wrapper.
Also, at some point gtorrent is going to fully separate it's core from it's GUI, and this code will need to be changed to that.
