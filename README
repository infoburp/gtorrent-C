This is a wrapper that allows non-harmful C code to use the harmful C++ code that gtorrent's core uses.
This is ONLY the core, not the GUI.

The C header file to include is "core/gtorrent-core.h".

gtorrent is under heavy development and is very likely to change and break this wrapper.

Compile with "make test"

I honestly have no idea how the memory management works when it's done like this.
